# primal-scourge-tool

Just a thing I decided to make for easy hosting and interaction in my PMD&D campaign, Primal Scourge. For the moment, it is being hardcoded to work with it and its gameplay system, but it will be expanded in the future to allow for other systems as well.

This project is being written in Visual Studio 2017, and uses SFML and SFGUI, and Discord Rich Presence support will be added soon. I'm not entirely sure how exactly I should be handling credits and such for these libraries; this is my first actual public project (that I intend to see through to the end), so I apologize for my ineptitude. If anyone would like to inform me on such matters, it would be greatly appreciated.
